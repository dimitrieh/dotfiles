# A very slightly quicker way to checkout a remote branch when it does not yet exist on your local repository
#
# $1 - The remote on which the branch resides
# $2 - The branch you want to checkout
#
# Examples
#
#   git-checkout-remote-branch branch-a origin
#
#   or
#
#   git-checkout-remote-branch branch-b
#

git fetch ${2:-origin} && git checkout -b $1 "${2:-origin}/$1"
