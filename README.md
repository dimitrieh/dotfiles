# Dotfiles

## Install

Run this:

```sh
script/bootstrap  # Initial setup - creates symlinks for *.symlink files
script/install    # App-specific setup - runs all install.sh scripts
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

## How it works

### Installation Process

1. **Bootstrap** (`script/bootstrap`)
   - Prompts for git author name/email if not configured
   - Creates symlinks for all `*.symlink` files to your home directory
   - Installs homebrew dependencies on macOS

2. **Install Scripts** (`script/install`)
   - Automatically finds and runs all `install.sh` scripts in any subdirectory
   - Each application's `install.sh` handles its specific setup (creating directories, symlinks, etc.)

### Conventions

- **`*.symlink`** - Any file ending in `.symlink` gets automatically symlinked to `~` during bootstrap
  - Example: `git/gitconfig.symlink` â†’ `~/.gitconfig`

- **`install.sh`** - Scripts that handle application-specific setup
  - Automatically discovered and executed by `script/install`
  - Should check for dependencies, create necessary symlinks, and validate setup

- **`*.zsh`** - Shell configuration files that get automatically sourced by zsh
  - `aliases.zsh` - Command aliases specific to that tool (e.g., docker aliases, git shortcuts)
  - `path.zsh` - PATH modifications for that tool
  - `completion.zsh` - Shell completions
  - All `.zsh` files are loaded automatically by the zsh configuration

### Adding New Applications

To add configuration for a new application:

1. Create a directory with the application name
2. Add your configuration files
3. Either:
   - Name files with `.symlink` suffix for automatic linking to home directory
   - Create an `install.sh` script for custom setup logic
4. Run `script/install` to execute your new install script
