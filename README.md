# Dotfiles

## install

Run this:

```sh
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are configured with a Hyper key. The layout can be found [here](https://dimitrieh.gitlab.io/dotfiles)
