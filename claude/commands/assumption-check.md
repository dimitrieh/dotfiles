# Assumption Validation

I will validate the assumption or decision about: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Process

Rather than making assumptions, I will:

1. **Identify the assumption** - Clearly state what needs validation
2. **Research thoroughly** - Use multiple sources and tools to gather evidence
3. **Analyze findings** - Compare and synthesize information from various sources
4. **Present validated conclusions** - Provide evidence-based recommendations

## Validation Methods

- **Web Research**: Search for current best practices, documentation, and expert opinions
- **Repository Analysis**: Examine similar projects and implementations
- **Documentation Review**: Check official documentation and specifications
- **Community Insights**: Look for discussions, issues, and real-world experiences

The goal is to replace assumptions with validated, evidence-based decisions.
